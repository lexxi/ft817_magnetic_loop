# ft817_magnetic_loop
This is a fork from --> https://github.com/8cH9azbsFifZ/arduino_ft817/tree/master/examples/ft_817_automatic_loop

The code is based on Alain De Carolis, WW3WW, FT-817 Automatic Loop Tuner (https://code.google.com/p/ft-817-automatic-loop/)
   
This progam uses a modified version of the qrptracker library
written by Bruce Gordon Robertson, VE9QRP
    
released under the GPL V3 license
    
I have added a 16x2 LCD display with some infos of the rig an the possibility to work with a digital interface and 
this tuner.
